# RTC-Video-Chat

Posting some practice on WebRTC

    Open a terminal in the root directory of our project.
    Run the following command â€” node index.js .
    Open Google Chrome and visit localhost:8000 . Enter a room name (say foo). You should see your video.
    Open a new tab and visit localhost:8000 . Enter the same room name (foo). You should now see two video elements.
